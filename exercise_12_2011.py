# 12. The last piece of cake
# Equilibrium index of a sequence is an index such that the sum of elements at lower indexes
# is equal to the sum of elements at higher indexes.
# Create a function that receives an array of integers and returns the first equilibrium index
# found. If no equilibrium index found, the function should return -1
# For example, if the array received is :
# A = [-7, 1, 5, 2, -4, 3, 0]
# 3 is an equilibrium index, because:
# A[0]+A[1]+A[2] = A[4]+A[5]+A[6]
# In other words, you should find the index of the array where the sum of the left elements is
# equal to the sum of the right elements.
# In the example, the function will return 3, because itâ€™s the first equilibrium index found in the
# array.
# The function receives an array of integers and return an integer
