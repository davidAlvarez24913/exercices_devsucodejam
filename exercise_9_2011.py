# . The power of two
# Given a positive integer number determine if itâ€™s the power of two of another integer.
# Donâ€™t start coding, read the limitations.
# For example:
# If the function receives 25, it should return TRUE, because 5^2 = 25
# If the function receives 1, it should return TRUE, because 1^2 = 1
# If the function receives 16, it should return TRUE, because 4^2 = 16
# If the function receives 14, it should return FALSE.
# Limitation: You CANâ€™T use functions of square roots (sqrt() or similar), potentiation (pow() or
# similar). ONLY the basic arithmetic operations (sum, substraction, multiplication, division),
# and any logic operations are allowed.
# The function receives a positive integer greater than 0, and should return a boolean value.
