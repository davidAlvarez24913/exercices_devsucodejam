# 11. Counter
# Given an array of integers, find which is repeated more times. Return the number that has
# more repetitions. If two numbers has the same amount of repetitions, return the lower
# number.
# For example, given this array:
# A = [1, 5, 3, -2, 4, 2, 4, -2, 5, 5, 2, 1, 3]
# 1 is repeated 2 times
# 5 is repeated 3 times
# 3 is repeated 2 times
# -2 is once
# 4 is repeated 2 times
# 2 is repeated 2 times
# The most repeated number is 5. The function should return: 5. (Because 5 is repeated 3
#                                                                times in the array).
# The function will receive an array of integers and return an integer.
