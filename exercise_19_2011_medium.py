# 19. Ok, letâ€™s the party begin...
# Create a function that receives a 32 bit integer and return the number of ones in the binary of
# that number. (caution: looping through testing each bit is not a solution).
# The function can receive any positive 32 bit integer.
# For example:
# If the function receives 25, it should return 3. Why? Because 25 in binary is 11001, which
# has 3 ones.
# The function will receive an integer and return an integer.
